** General App Idea**

1 -     Create a form, 'New Book' button, and an empty card.
2 -     Only the button should be visible at first.
3 -     After button click, bring forward the form on a card.
4 -     The form details are put to a new empty card. New card has a spot on page.
5 -     The process should be repeatable, with new cards being added to the page.

-- Pseudocode for Step 3 --

1 -     Create button that brings existing form to the front of screen.
2 -     Should be centre screen with background blurred and locked.
3 -     Submitting the form should store the information in the array.

-- Pseudocode for Step 4 --

1 -     Write a function that loops through the Library array and displays a specific book.
2 -     Create a form in HTML that can accept answers.
3 -     Link the function and the form.
