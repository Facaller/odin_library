** General App Idea**

1 -     Create a form, 'New Book' button, and an empty card.
2 -     Only the button should be visible at first.
3 -     After button click, bring forward the form on a card.
4 -     The form details are put to a new empty card. New card has a spot on page.
5 -     The process should be repeatable, with new cards being added to the page.
6 -     Each card can be edited.
7 -     The reading status can be toggled.
8 -     The book (card) can be removed.
9 -     A tab at the bottom of the screen shows the collected stats of the books.

-- Pseudocode for Step 3 --

1 -     Create button that brings existing form to the front of screen.
2 -     Should be centre screen with background blurred and locked.
3 -     Submitting the form should store the information in the array.

-- Pseudocode for Step 4 --

1 -     Submit button should create a div with card class.
2 -     Card should slot in horizontally.
3 -     Cards contents should be what was just submitted on the form.
4 -     Or should be added to array and function loops through array to add new item.

-- Pseudocode for Step 6 --

1 -     Create a function that can edit an object in set.
2 -     Edit button brings up the form again.
3 -     Form inputs should be current card data.
4 -     New form inputs should edit current card on screen and in array.
5 -     Set old data to new data using the function.
6 -     Set item should be the same with updated details.
